# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using machine learning techniques. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The project demonstrates how to train a model for image classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of the 10 categories:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is publicly available. You can download it from the following link:
